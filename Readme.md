# Simple WatchConnectivity app - Swift 6 - Incorrect actor executor assumption

I created this simple WatchConnectivity app to demonstrate an issue I was having with `@preconcurrency import WatchConnectivity`.
The Issue was posted on [forums.swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/t/watchconnectivity-swift-6-incorrect-actor-executor-assumption/76064)/

- [`main`](https://github.com/justmejulian/SimpleWatchConnectivity/tree/main) branch contains the broken example.
- [`fix`](https://github.com/justmejulian/SimpleWatchConnectivity/tree/fix) branch contains the potential fix.
